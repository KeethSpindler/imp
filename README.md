## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (required by project configuration)
- A Discord Bot account ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** package manager (recommended)
- OR pip (legacy support)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/imp.git
   cd imp
   ```

2. **Create Discord Application**
   - Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a new application
   - Navigate to the "Bot" section and create a bot
   - Copy both the Bot Token and Application ID

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id_here
   ```
   
   **Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file or share your tokens publicly.

4. **Install dependencies and run**

   Using uv (recommended):
   ```bash
   uv sync
   cd ./src
   uv run python -m imp_bot.bot
   ```

   Using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   python src/imp_bot/bot.py
   ```

5. **Invite bot to server**
   - Use the Application ID from your environment variables
   - Visit: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&permissions=274877906944&scope=applications.commands%20bot`
   - Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual Application ID

## Architecture

Imp follows a modular Discord.py architecture with clean separation of concerns:

### Core Components

- **`imp_bot/bot.py`** - Main bot entry point with ImpBot class extending discord.ext.commands.Bot
- **`imp_bot/cogs/`** - Interactive command modules (currently: Bartender)
- **`imp_bot/models/`** - Pydantic data models for type safety and validation
- **`imp_bot/utils/`** - Utility modules organized by function:
  - **`clients/`** - HTTP clients for external API integration
  - **`embedders/`** - Discord embed formatting utilities  
  - **`colors/`** - Consistent color scheme management
  - **`formatters/`** - Data formatting utilities
  - **`sanitizers/`** - Input sanitization helpers
  - **`validators/`** - Input validation utilities

### Current Dependencies

- **discord.py** - Discord API wrapper for Python
- **pydantic** - Data validation using Python type annotations
- **httpx** - Modern HTTP client for asynchronous API calls
- **python-dotenv** - Environment variable management
- **aiohttp** - Additional async HTTP functionality

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Install in editable mode
uv sync
cd ./src
uv run python -m imp_bot.bot
```

### Adding New Cogs

1. Create a new cog file in `src/imp_bot/cogs/`
2. Follow the established pattern:
   ```python
   from discord.ext import commands
   
   class YourCog(commands.Cog):
       def __init__(self, bot):
           self.bot = bot
           
       # Your command methods here
   
   async def setup(bot):
       await bot.add_cog(YourCog(bot))
   ```
3. The bot automatically loads all `.py` files in the cogs directory

### Testing

Run the included test suite:
```bash
# Run tests with pytest
uv run pytest tests/

# Or run specific test files
uv run pytest tests/drinks/drink_model_test.ipynb
```
